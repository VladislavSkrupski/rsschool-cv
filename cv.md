## __About Me__
Within the frame of my last job, I independently and successfully implemented 1 project (stack: Java, JavaFX, Maven, Git â€“ github.com/VladislavSkrupski/technologData). As a part of the completed courses and self-study, I also know Spring (Boot, MVC, Data). Despite the long work in the furniture industry, past experience, although indirectly, is still connected with the IT sphere. During my work, I solved a large number of problems related to the software and production equipment. Configuring postprocessors to generate control programs for machine tools. Established the infrastructure of electronic document management between the design engineering department and production. Trained the staff in the work and intricacies of work in the Bazis system (Bazissoft), BiesseWorks, Artcam, etc. In my opinion, the experience and soft skills I have gained may be useful at a future job. Why did I choose the path of a developer after a long time? I love complex systems and complex electronics, I like to repair them and explore their structure, and software development makes it possible to manage them.
